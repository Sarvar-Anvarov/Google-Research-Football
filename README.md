# Google Research Football with Manchester City F.C.
Train agents to master the world's most popular sport

This is a competition held in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-football/overview/description). The goal of the competition is to train agents (bots) to play football. My solution is rule-based which means that the agent behaves according to special rules written in code. Top competitors' solutions use reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning technique that enables an agent to learn in an interactive environment by trial and error using feedback from its own actions and experiences.

Built bots play against each other during the competition period to gain points. A team with the most points wins.

## Results
My solution ranked 35th out of 1138 teams.
